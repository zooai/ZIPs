# ZIP-500: ESG Principles for Conservation Impact

## Abstract

This ZIP establishes the foundational ESG framework for Zoo Labs Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to wildlife conservation through decentralized technology. As a mission-driven organization, our ESG commitments are not ancillary—they are core to our existence. This document defines our conservation impact model, ethical partnerships policy, and transparency commitments. All related ZIPs reference this as the canonical source for Zoo's impact framework.

## Mission and Impact Thesis

Zoo Labs Foundation exists to **democratize AI while protecting biodiversity**. We believe technology should serve both humanity and the natural world. Our impact thesis: **decentralized systems can coordinate conservation efforts at global scale** by aligning economic incentives with ecological outcomes. Every token, every transaction, every model we support should contribute to measurable conservation impact.

## Conservation Impact Model

### What "Success" Means

| Timeframe | Success Definition | Key Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **1 Year** | Operational impact system | Monitoring 10+ species, 1M+ hectares |
| **3 Years** | Measurable conservation outcomes | Documented population improvements |
| **10 Years** | Ecosystem-scale impact | Contributed to species recovery, habitat restoration |

### Impact Boundaries

**What we measure:**
- Direct impact: Conservation outcomes from Zoo-funded projects
- Indirect impact: Ecosystem value enabled by Zoo technology
- Attribution: Clear methodology for claiming impact

**What we don't claim:**
- Impact from unrelated conservation efforts
- Theoretical or projected impact without verification
- Impact from partners without audit trail

## Material Topics

### Environmental

| Topic | Materiality | Boundary | Metrics |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Species protection | Critical | Target species programs | Population trends, range data |
| Habitat preservation | Critical | Monitored areas | Hectares protected, degradation rates |
| Anti-poaching | High | Patrol networks | Incidents prevented, response time |
| Ecosystem health | High | Monitored ecosystems | Biodiversity indices |
| Carbon impact | Medium | Network operations | tCO2e sequestered vs. emitted |

### Social

| Topic | Materiality | Boundary | Metrics |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Community benefit | High | Local communities | Livelihoods supported, participation |
| Indigenous rights | Critical | Traditional territories | FPIC compliance, benefit sharing |
| Scientific access | High | Research community | Open data availability, citations |
| Education | Medium | Public engagement | Reach, learning outcomes |

### Governance

| Topic | Materiality | Boundary | Metrics |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Non-profit compliance | Critical | 501(c)(3) operations | Audit findings, IRS filings |
| Grant transparency | High | Funding allocation | Public reporting, traceability |
| DAO governance | High | Protocol decisions | Participation, proposal outcomes |
| Ethical partnerships | Critical | All partners | Screening compliance |

## Ethical Partnerships Policy

### Who We Partner With

- Conservation organizations with verified track records
- Research institutions with ethical review boards
- Technology companies committed to responsible AI
- Indigenous communities with meaningful consent

### Who We Refuse

| Category | Rationale | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Wildlife exploitation** | Conflicts with mission | Trophy hunting operators, exotic pet trade |
| **Greenwashing** | Damages credibility | Unverified carbon offsets, fake conservation |
| **Human rights violators** | Ethical obligation | Forced displacement, child labor |
| **Weapons manufacturers** | Mission incompatible | Defense contractors, surveillance for oppression |
| **Fossil fuel majors** | Climate conflict | Oil/gas extraction companies |

### Partner Screening Process

1. **Initial screening**: Against exclusion list
2. **Due diligence**: Background check, reference verification
3. **Ethics review**: Zoo Ethics Committee approval for material partnerships
4. **Ongoing monitoring**: Annual re-verification
5. **Termination clause**: Right to exit for ethics violations

### Community Protections

- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)**: Required for projects affecting indigenous communities
- **Benefit sharing**: Equitable distribution of economic benefits
- **Data sovereignty**: Communities control their data
- **No harm**: Projects must not displace or disadvantage local communities

## Transparency and Reporting

### Public Reporting

| Report | Frequency | Content |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Annual Impact Report** | Yearly | Conservation outcomes, financials, governance |
| **Quarterly Update** | Quarterly | Progress metrics, grant deployment |
| **Project Reports** | Per-project | Outcomes, learnings, next steps |
| **Incident Reports** | As needed | Safety issues, ethics violations, responses |

### Open Data Policy

| Data Type | Access Level | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Conservation outcomes** | Public | Accountability |
| **Financial flows** | Public | Non-profit transparency |
| **Model architectures** | Open source | Mission alignment |
| **Training data** | Varies | Balance openness with poaching risk |
| **Location data** | Restricted | Protect vulnerable species |

### What We Gate (and Why)

- **Real-time poaching alerts**: Could enable poachers
- **Exact species locations**: Endangers vulnerable populations
- **Individual animal identifiers**: Privacy for research subjects
- **Partner confidential info**: Contractual obligations

## Governance Structure

### DAO Governance

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **$ZOO Token Holders** | Protocol governance votes |

| Habitat health | Quarterly | Remote sensing + field verification |
| Community benefit | Annual | Third-party survey |
| Financial audit | Annual | Independent CPA firm |

### External Review

- **Financial statements**: Annual audit per 501(c)(3) requirements
- **Technology audit**: Security and AI safety review
- **Ethics review**: External ethics board assessment

## Known Tradeoffs

### Conservation vs. Openness

- **Tradeoff**: Full transparency could endanger species
- **Mitigation**: Risk-based disclosure, data gating
- **Disclosure**: We will explain what we withhold and why

### Scale vs. Depth

- **Tradeoff**: Monitoring more hectares vs. deeper engagement
- **Mitigation**: Tiered monitoring (broad + intensive)
- **Disclosure**: We will report coverage and depth separately

### Technology vs. Traditional Knowledge

- **Tradeoff**: AI systems vs. indigenous knowledge
- **Mitigation**: Integration, not replacement; co-design with communities
- **Disclosure**: We will credit traditional knowledge sources

### Growth vs. Impact Quality

- **Tradeoff**: Rapid scaling vs. rigorous impact measurement
- **Mitigation**: Impact verification gates on expansion
- **Disclosure**: We will report unverified vs. verified impact separately
