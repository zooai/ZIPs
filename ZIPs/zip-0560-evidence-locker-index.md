# ZIP-560: Evidence Locker Index

## Abstract

This ZIP serves as the centralized index for all conservation impact and governance evidence artifacts maintained by Zoo Labs Foundation. It catalogs policies, impact reports, conservation data, community agreements, and attestations that support claims made in ZIP-500 and related proposals. This is the "credibility engine" that makes our conservation impact verifiable.

## Purpose

As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, funders and partners require:
1. **Impact evidence**: Proof that conservation outcomes are achieved
2. **Financial accountability**: Documentation of fund deployment
3. **Ethical compliance**: Records of community consent and protection
4. **Scientific validity**: Peer-reviewed methodologies and data

This index serves as the single entry point for all conservation evidence.
