# ZIP-3: Zoo-1 (z1) Model Architecture - MoE with v-JEPA for Metaverse Animal Behaviors

## Abstract

This proposal defines Zoo-1 (z1), Zoo's native foundation model that combines Qwen3's Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture with Meta's v-JEPA (Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) to learn from virtualized animal behaviors in the metaverse. The z1-32B model creates emergent AI behaviors by observing and predicting animal movement patterns, social dynamics, and environmental interactions in virtual worlds.

## Motivation

Current AI models lack understanding of natural movement and social behaviors:

1. **Static Training**: Models trained on text/images miss temporal dynamics
2. **No Embodiment**: Lack understanding of physical movement and space
3. **Poor Social Modeling**: Can't predict group behaviors and interactions
4. **Limited Transfer**: Gaming AI doesn't transfer to real applications
5. **No Emergence**: Scripted behaviors rather than learned patterns

Zoo-1 learns from virtualized animal ecosystems to create truly emergent AI.
