# Zoo Improvement Proposals (ZIPs)

Zoo Improvement Proposals (ZIPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, gathering community input, and documenting design decisions for the [Zoo](https://zoo.fund) ecosystem. This process ensures that changes to the Zoo platform are transparently reviewed and achieve community consensus before implementation.

**🦁 Zoo: AI-Powered DeFi, Gaming & Education Platform** - An EVM L2 (Chain ID: 200200) on Lux Network, serving as the LP-R (Registry) for the decentralized AI ecosystem.

## What is a ZIP?

A Zoo Improvement Proposal (ZIP) is a design document that provides information to the Zoo community about a proposed change to the system. ZIPs serve as the formal pathway to introduce improvements and build agreement on their adoption. They are used for:
- Proposing new DeFi protocols and NFT standards
- Defining AI-powered gaming mechanics
- Collecting community input on metaverse features
- Documenting design decisions for DAO governance
